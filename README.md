# Selective_Tracker

This Python code tracks objects in a video stream using the OpenCV library. We can select any object we desire to track for the whole video by selecting our object of interest ( we are using the selectROI() function ;) ).

After cloning this repository, execute the object_tracking.py file. In the folder, place the video on which you want to test this code. Then run this file. After entering the correct file input, a ROI Selector file will open which will ask you to select your object of interest to track. Run the video after selection by pressing the Space Bar or the Enter key. The tracked object will be within a green bounding box.
